# xs-dom

A virtual-dom library tailored to Cycle.js

## Want to try this stuff out? (Sorry, not yet!)

```
$ npm install xs-dom
```

This has started a fork of snabbdom to TypeScript, 
but will continue to evolve into a more and more specific solution 
for Cycle.js. No priority will be given to it working outside of Cycle.js 
(though it may still work in other places).
